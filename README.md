# Cross-Cultural Music Recommendation Research System

A research-quality music recommendation system analyzing cross-cultural preferences (Vietnamese + Western music) with sophisticated temporal modeling. This project serves as foundational research for World Models, focusing on latent representation learning, temporal dynamics, and causal inference.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- **Latent Space Analysis**: Discover interpretable factors driving cross-cultural music preferences
- **Temporal Modeling**: Track and predict evolving musical tastes over time  
- **Cultural Bridge Discovery**: Identify gateway songs facilitating cross-cultural exploration
- **Causal Inference**: Establish causal relationships in preference formation and cultural adoption
- **World Models Preparation**: Build foundational understanding of sequential latent representations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n music-research python=3.10
conda activate music-research

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Spotify API credentials
# Get credentials at: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
```

### 3. Run Data Exploration
```bash
